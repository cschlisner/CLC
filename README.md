# CLC - Case Lights Controller

This is a Windows application that communicates with the included Arduino code to control a PWM pin. This is meant to be used in conjunction with a circuit controlling lights, but do whatever you want; I don't really care.



##Installation
1. Load the Arduino/CLC.ino onto your Arduino and make sure it's on COM3

2. Simply put the "CLC app" directory wherever you want and run CLC.exe
