# CLC - Case Lights Controller

This is a Windows application that communicates with the included Arduino code to control a PWM pin. This is meant to be used in conjunction with a circuit controlling lights, but do whatever you want; I don't really care.



##Installation
1. Load the Arduino/CLC/CLC.ino program onto your Arduino

2. Simply put the "CLC app" directory wherever you want and run CLC.exe

3. Choose the sound device you want to monitor with the first dropdown

4. Choose the COM port your arduino is on with the second dropdown
