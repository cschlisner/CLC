# CLC - Case Lights Controller

This is a Windows application that communicates with the included Arduino code to control a PWM pin. This is meant to be used in conjunction with a circuit controlling lights, but do whatever you want; I don't really care.



##Installation

Simply put the CLC-master/CLC directory wherever you want and run CLC.exe
